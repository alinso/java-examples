# Radial Text PDF

This example shows how to draw a circle of radial texts with a rainbow colors
effect. The application replicates the drawing on three distinct documents in
A3, A4 and A5 paper sizes.

### Requirements

* Java 5 or higher

### Output

The application generates the following PDF files:

* [radial-text-a3.pdf](radial-text-a3.pdf?raw=true)
* [radial-text-a4.pdf](radial-text-a4.pdf?raw=true)
* [radial-text-a5.pdf](radial-text-a5.pdf?raw=true)

### Notes

This example is based on Apache PDFBox version **1.8.11** (referenced as Maven
*dependency*). However, it should also work with other versions of PDFBox.
