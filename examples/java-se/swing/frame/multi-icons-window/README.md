# Multi Icons Window

This example shows how to apply a list of images to a `javax.swing.JFrame` for
the window icon so that the platform/Operating System can choose the most
appropriate icon(s) from the list.

This example uses the new `setIconImages(List<? extends Image> icons)` method
available since Java 6 in `java.awt.Window` and all subclasses (like `JFrame`).

The icons in this example are expressly in different colors so that you can
clearly see how/where the platform/Operating System uses them.

### Requirements

* Java 6 or higher

### Screenshots

### Notes

The seven icon images are created by **me**, you are free to reuse them for
whatever you want. I release these icons as "freeware".
