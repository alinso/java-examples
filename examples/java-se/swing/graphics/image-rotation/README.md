# Image Rotation

This example shows how to draw an image that can be rotated from 0 to 360 degrees.
The user can change the rotation angle (in degrees) using a `JSlider` component
and can select the &ldquo;interpolation&rdquo; hint (controls how image pixels
are filtered/resampled during an image rendering).
