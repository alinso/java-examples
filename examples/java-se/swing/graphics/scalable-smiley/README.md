# Scalable Smiley

This example shows how to draw a *scalable* "smiley" using the Java 2D API and
the *custom painting* in a component that extends `javax.swing.JPanel`.

If you resize the frame, the smiley will scale proportionally in the correct
way and also keeping the aspect ratio. The scaling is realized using math
calculations on all coordinates and sizes.
