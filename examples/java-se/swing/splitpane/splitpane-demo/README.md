# Split Pane Demo

This example shows how to use the `javax.swing.JSplitPane` component both in
the vertical and horizontal orientations.
The components into `JSplitPane` are instances of a simple class `EllipsePaintPanel`
(extension of `javax.swing.JPanel`) that draws an ellipse sized to fit the
component surface.

**Hint**: try the source code and "play" with minimum sizes, the *resizeWeight*
property and also try the difference between `setContinuousLayout(true)` and
`setContinuousLayout(false)`.
