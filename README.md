# Java Examples by andbin

The **Java Examples** project is exclusively developed by [Andrea Binello](http://www.andbin.net)
(&ldquo;andbin&rdquo;) to provide a set of valid, useful and enjoyable examples
about the *Java programming language*, the *Java SE* (Standard Edition) framework
and other libraries.

### :point_right: **[Table of contents](examples/README.md)**

## Features

The following are the overall features of the examples:

* generally **short** (in average 2 to 6 Java source files)
* very **well written** (following standard code and naming conventions)
* **commented** (in english only language)
* **self contained** (no dependencies on other examples, no particular editor/IDE requirements)
* provided with screenshots for GUI examples
* provided with a `build.xml` file for building with [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org)
  (more complex examples may have a `pom.xml` for building with [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org))

## License

All the examples are licensed under the **MIT License**, a very *permissive*
free software license. See the full text of the license:
