# :coffee: Java Examples by andbin

The **Java Examples** project is a set of examples developed and provided exclusively
by [Andrea Binello](http://www.andbin.net) (&ldquo;andbin&rdquo;) about the *Java programming
language*.

The goal of this project is to provide valid, useful and enjoyable examples
about the use of the Java language, the Java SE (Standard Edition) framework
and other libraries.

See :point_right: **[Table of contents](examples/README.md)**

## :bulb: Features

The following are the overall features of the examples:

* generally **short** (in average 2 to 6 Java source files)
* very **well written** (following standard code and naming conventions)
* **commented** (english only language)
* **self contained** (no dependencies on other examples, no particular editor/IDE requirements)
* provided with screenshots for GUI examples
* provided with a `build.xml` file for building with [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org)
  (more complex examples may have a `pom.xml` for [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org))
